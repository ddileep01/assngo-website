              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 pl-8 pr-8">
                Origins of Akhanda Seva Samsthan The journey of Akhanda Seva
                Samsthan began with a simple yet profound idea - the belief that
                "anyone who serves the country is a true leader.‚Äù. Rayapureddy
                Purna Dayakar, president, along with his passionate friends
                Ganesh Nadipalli, Gowri Naidu Kolusu, Avinash Tammireddy, Kedhar
                Eswar, and Raghu Aratlakota, have shaped the organization, which
                is instrumental in taking its first step towards creating an
                inclusive society, driven by compassion and a sense of duty
                towards the less fortunate. Having its roots in Rajiv Gandhi
                University of Knowledge Technologies, the organization consists
                of young, dynamic, passionate, and energetic individuals who
                strive for excellence in their work. As members of the RGUKT,
                they are also responsive to the needs of RGUKTIANS, which gives
                the organization a student-friendly, student-driven, and
                student-motivated characteristic.

                Founders and their inspirations
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 pl-8 pr-8">
                The founders of Akhanda Seva Samsthan drew inspiration from the
                teachings of prominent leaders and visionaries who advocated for
                social justice and equality. As the President of Akhanda Seva
                Samsthan, Rayapureddy Purna Dayakar is an enthusiastic and
                passionate individual who has always been motivated by a desire
                to make a positive impact on the lives of others. This motivated
                him to seek out like-minded friends, who ultimately helped form
                Akhanda Seva Samsthan. It is their actions that speak louder
                than their words. With their commitment and endurance, the
                organization has conducted more than 50+ community-driven
                programs. In this process, they followed inclusivity,
                transparency, and integrity as their guiding values. Their
                unwavering commitment to the cause laid the foundation for a
                movement that would touch countless lives and leave an indelible
                mark on society.
